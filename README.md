# Air Quality Analysis README

## Introduction
This repository contains R code for analyzing air quality data related to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution. The analysis focuses on comparing air quality data from two different years, 1999 and 2012, to understand how the air quality index has changed over time. This README provides an overview of the analysis and instructions for replicating it.

## Code Description
The R code (`air_quality_analysis.R`) in this repository performs the following tasks:
1. Reads and preprocesses air quality data for the years 1999 and 2012.
2. Compares summary statistics of the air quality data for both years.
3. Explores the presence of negative values in the air quality data for 2012.
4. Converts date columns to the Dates class and visualizes the distribution of data over time.
5. Explores changes at the monitor and state levels.
6. Generates plots to visualize air quality changes.

## Usage Instructions
To replicate the air quality analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
